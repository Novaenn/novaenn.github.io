- Configured a Road Warrior tunnel with OpenVPN and an internal tunnel with IPSec.
- Hardened the network by applying various security policies to Management, Control and Data Planes.

[JSFormGrabbing](https://github.com/Novaenn/JSFormGrabbing)
- Mock website built for my bachelor‚Äôs thesis that was used as a proof-of-concept for a Man-in-the-Browser
attack. The site implements malicious Javascript code which sends the credentials that have been inserted
in a form to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

[Malware Detection with malware images using CNN techniques](https://github.com/Novaenn/Malware-Detection)
- Developed a Malware Detection System (MDS) able to provide a significant contribution to defense
against malicious attacks.
- While a traditional MDS uses feature extraction ML algorithms, the project aimed to develop a CNN
which was trained to classify an executable file as malware or benign.
