## Tools 🔧

I use on a daily basis: \
    • I use ***GNU/Linux*** as my main OS \
    • I use ***bash*** or ***zsh*** as my shells \
    • ***vim*** for text editing \
    • ***git*** for version control \
    • Various front-end frameworks such as ***Hugo*** (The framework that I used to build this website)     
    • LaTeX / Markdown / toml / JSON 

## Technologies 💻

I mainly choose between ***Python***, ***C*** or ***Java*** as my main programming languages, even though I dabbled in ***MIPS assembly*** and ***C++***.

## Studying 🧠

I'm currently learning about: \
    • ***Vue.js*** \
    • ***Go*** \
    • ***Docker*** \
    • ***Kubernetes***

I also started reading some research papers regarding the field of system vulnerabilities. I recently finished [Meltdown and Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/) and am currently reading about other security vulnerabilities that exploit speculative execution such as [PACMAN](https://pacmanattack.com/).
