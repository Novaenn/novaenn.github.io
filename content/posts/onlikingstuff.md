This post will talk about my thoughts on having multiple interests and having the time to satisfy them.

<!--more-->

Lately, I became really interested in multiple subjects which were very far conceptually from Computer Science, my current field of study. 
Some of them were _probably_ caused by me having a crush on a girl who had knowledge ranging from the more scientific subjects like mathematics to more humanistic fields like [philosophy](https://iai.tv/articles/the-courage-to-face-a-lifetime-on-the-enduring-value-of-ayn-rands-philosophy-auid-846), [art](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/06/08/edward-hopper-and-american-solitude?utm_source=pocket_saves) and [literature](https://www.theschooloflife.com/article/what-is-literature-for-3/). <br>
(I explain more deeply about how I exploit to my advantage crushes that may or may not be successful in the post ["On attraction, having a crush and Limerence"](/posts/on-attraction-having-a-crush-and-limerence/)). 


## What caused the rambling
Recently I stumbled upon a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu2T1_rbF1s) from R.C. Waldun that introduced the idea of being a ***Multipotentialite***.
> A multipotentialite is a person who has many different interests and creative pursuits in life. 

I usually pick up a skill or subject I'm interested in, and then, after having reached my desired "skill level", I lose interest and move on to another topic. Has something similar ever happened to you?


## The "Problem"
So you might ask: "What's wrong with liking different stuff? Isn't it amazing to be constantly fascinated by random things, serendipity on your side and all?". Well, it's a bit more complicated than that.

While having a quasi-infinite bucket list of things to learn and explore is indeed terrific, finding the time to pursue those interests _is_ less so. In these months the number of my interests has greatly increased, which isn't great since I'm in the middle of exam sessions.

[Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84456037-samuele) are usually the culprit, but [blogs](https://weeklymusings.net/) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1PC1sArw70&list=PLO17mUvu8KA1IxHXLcoKtpGrfuPI0THu9&index=1&t=404s) play a part in it as well.

I occasionally fail to balance other important things in life such as studying for exams, nurturing social relationships, and getting some entertainment in order to pursue whatever I encountered by happenstance.

## How I solve it
To combat my never ending supply of procrastination I force myself to respect a strict schedule everytime I need to prepare for an exam or when I have other important tasks to handle. 
I like to mix [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) and [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to sort my short and long-term goals.
I create events in GCal to organize and not forget every type of event I have to attend and use Todoist to create a to-do list ordered by priority for the things that I have to accomplish during the day.  
With this method, I consistently manage to finish my important daily tasks and satisfy my curiosity without sacrificing one or the other.  

## Conclusion
To conclude, I advise everyone to pursue every single thing that they are passionate about. When you encounter something remotely interesting, I suggest throwing yourself into it (if you have time, of course) and seeing where it leads, you might be surprised by the number of interesting things that we ignore daily.
