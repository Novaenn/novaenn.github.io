*Who the hell uses IPX and NCP in 2025? This guy. Can you help me find the flag?*
NCPunk'd is a Network challenge from the SnakeCTF Quals.

The .pcap file we are given seems to be a capture of a legacy Novell NetWare network. The packets show a client performing DNS queries, communicating with a router via RIP, and then establishing a connection and interacting with a NetWare server using the IPX, SAP, and NCP protocols.
{{< figure src="images/NCPunkd_Capture.png" alt="NCPunk'd Capture" >}}

The **Internetwork Packet Exchange** (IPX) is a network-layer protocol used during the 1980s while the **Network Control Protocol** (NCP) is a communication protocol which provided the transport layer of the protocol stack running on host computers of the ARPANET.

From frame 180 onwards, we have a huge number of client requests "C Get Volume and Purge Information for Volume" which means that the client is making a request to the server to get information about a specific volume.

Frame 6235 is the next interesting packet. Here, the client is performing a "*C Obtain Info for: admin.logs*" command, which asks the server for various information regarding the file admin.logs. A couple of packets later we see the command "*C Open/Create File or Subdirectory*" on the admin.logs file. This means that the client has the intention of reading the file and has opened a file handle for it.
This handle is used in "*C Read From File*" and "*C Close File*. 

This log file in particular does not contain anything exciting, but if we apply the display filter `_ws.col.info contains "C Read From File"` we can see every Read From File command that the client sent to the server.

Between them, Frame 6731 "*C Read From File - 0xea01e9010000*"  is the client request for reading the file called *flag.enc*, which is obviously very interesting. Unfortunately, the file contained the following:
>s9h4Vitm2h6J7cLrYc0w9zfRsBmAzLw/kNe0dlZbRguuDP9S1e4ofDxZWf6RXXXTCF6eRSkQeTWoUuSxKx0i8A==

which seems a simple Base64 Encoding but it is not. :(

Thankfully, just below we see a "*C Obtain Info for: admin_diary.txt*" which is an unusual filename.
The file contained the following message:
```
So you got your hands on the flag file already? Impressive.
But lets be clear: the real challenge isnt **finding** the flag  its **earning** it.
Sure, the encryption tool is in there somewhere...  
But good luck reversing **that**.
~~ ,_sys_admin_, ~~
```
Thank god Mr. sys_admin told us that the encryption tool is inside this packet capture otherwise I would have probably bashed my head figuring out how to decrypt that string.

On Wireshark, we can CTRL-F and search for all occurences of the string "Encrypt" in the packets and guess what? We find an *encrypt.pyc* file which is read, great!
The content read is not humanly-readable since a .pyc file is a Python compiled file that contains bytecode. 

Luckily for us, python decompilers such as [Uncompyle6](https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6) exist. They essentially translate Python bytecode back into equivalent Python source code.

First of all, however, we need to extract these files from the packet capture. 
To do this, we can write a magic python file which, with the help of scapy, extracts the files for us, even if they are fragmented into multiple packets such as the *encrypt.pyc* file:
{{< figure src="images/encrypt.pyc.png" alt="encrypt.pyc packet communication" >}}

```python
import sys
from scapy.all import rdpcap, Raw

# The size of the combined IPX and NCP headers to strip from each packet payload.
# (30-byte IPX header + 10-byte NCP Reply header)
HEADER_SIZE_TO_STRIP = 40

def extract_and_clean_frames(pcap_file, output_file, frame_numbers):
    print(f"[*] Reading packets from '{pcap_file}'...")
    try:
        packets = rdpcap(pcap_file)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[!] Error reading pcap file: {e}")
        return

    data_chunks = []
    
    print(f"[*] Targeting frames: {frame_numbers}")
    print(f"[*] Will strip {HEADER_SIZE_TO_STRIP} header bytes from each frame's payload.")
    
    for frame_num in frame_numbers:
        index = frame_num - 1
        
        if index < 0 or index >= len(packets):
            print(f"[!] Warning: Frame {frame_num} is out of bounds. Skipping.")
            continue
            
        packet = packets[index]
        
        if packet.haslayer(Raw):
            full_payload = packet[Raw].load
            
            # Check if the payload is large enough to strip the header
            if len(full_payload) > HEADER_SIZE_TO_STRIP:
                actual_data = full_payload[HEADER_SIZE_TO_STRIP:]
                data_chunks.append(actual_data)
                print(f"    [+] Frame {frame_num}: Extracted {len(actual_data)} bytes of data after stripping header.")
            else:
                print(f"    [!] Warning: Frame {frame_num} payload is too small ({len(full_payload)} bytes) to strip header. Skipping.")
        else:
            print(f"    [!] Warning: Frame {frame_num} has no raw data payload. Skipping.")

    if not data_chunks:
        print("\n[-] No data was extracted. Operation failed.")
        return

    print("\n[*] Combining cleaned data chunks...")
    full_data = b''.join(data_chunks)
    
    print(f"[*] Writing {len(full_data)} bytes to '{output_file}'...")
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(full_data)
        
    print(f"[+] Success! Clean file saved as '{output_file}'.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 4:
        print("Usage: python extract_frames_clean.py <input.pcap> <output_file> <frame_num1> <frame_num2> ...")

	frame_nums_to_extract = [int(n) for n in sys.argv[3:]]
    extract_and_clean_frames(pcap_path, output_path, frame_nums_to_extract)
``` 
Scapy probably has a better way to extract files, but this script essentially takes as input the frame numbers of the server's *R OK* responses, extracts the entire frame, and removes the IPX and NCP headers before saving the file.
With this, we can easily extract our *flag.enc* and *encrypt.pyc* files!

After the extraction, we use uncompyle on the .pyc file by running `uncompyle6 encrypt.pyc > encrypt.py`.
We finally get our encrypt.py: SIKE!

```
We get a `name 'opcode_38'is not defined`, this is because wwe have a version mismatch. The uncompyle6 binary decompiles from the system's python version (3.13.3 in this case) and if the bytecode is from an older version (3.8.0) we risk having deprecated opcodes that are not recognized by modern versions.

To fix this, I used [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), "An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust." which helped me create a quick virtual environment with python 3.8.0:
```bash
uv init
uv venv --python=3.8
uv add uncompyle6
uv run uncompyle6 encrypt.pyc > encrypt.py
```

This creates the following encrypt.py file:

Not really readable huh?

Renaming some functions and looking at the main operations we can see that this encryption function does basically the following things: 

1. `_0x4a2b1f`: This function is a custom Caesar Cipher implementation, it iterates through the input string and increments the ASCII value of each character by 1.
    - To reverse this we need to simply decrement the ASCII value of each character by 1.
2. Inside `_0x3efde3` the line *_0x4d22aa = _0xfe093c[None[None:-1]]* is a decompilation artifact. A very common operation that looks like this is a string reversal: *_0xfe093c[::-1]* so we'll assume that this is the intended operation.
    - To reverse this we simply reverse the string again.
3. `_0x9f1e2d`: This is the most complex function. It pads the input to a multiple of 16 bytes, processes it in 16-byte blocks, and scrambles each block using a 4x4 matrix. The scrambling consists of two operations repeated 3 times:
    1.  Diagonal Rotation: The elements on the main diagonal are rotated: (d0, d1, d2, d3) -> (d3, d0, d1, d2).
    2. Row Shift Left: Each row is shifted to the left by one position.
    - To reverse these operations we must perform the inverse operations in the reverse order, also 3 times:
        1. Row Shift Right: Shift each row to the right by one position.
        2.  Diagonal Rotation Backwards: Rotate the diagonal elements backwards: (d0, d1, d2, d3) -> (d1, d2, d3, d0).
        - Finally, we'll need to remove the null-byte padding (\x00) that was added. (Guess who forgot about it and spent 20 minutes wondering why the decrypted string was gibberish?)
4. `_0x7c8d3e`: This function XORs the data with a fixed 8-byte key [66, 26, 127, 51, 142, 33, 148, 87], nothing special.
    - To reverse this we know that the XOR is its own inverse, so we just need to apply the same function again.
5. `_0x3b9f2e`: This function uses a custom [Linear Congruential Generator ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator)(LCG) to create a pseudo-random stream of bytes, which is then XORed with the data. The LCG is seeded by the value s. This seed is calculated as: `len(plaintext) * 1337 + ord(plaintext[0]) * 42`. This is a problem, as we don't know the original plaintext's length (We do know the first character since every flag in the CTF starts with the prefix **snakeCTF{** so `plaintext[0] = "s"` and `ord(plaintext[0]) = 115`.
    - To reverse this is we need to apply the same function with the correct seed s.
6. In `_0x3efde3` we see a *base64.b64encode* which tells us that the final result is Base64 encoded (and that's why the format was familiar lol).
    - To reverse this we just *base64.b64decode* the data from flag.enc.

Most of these steps are easy to reverse so our *decrypt.py* file should be easy to write. However, we need to bruteforce `len(plaintext)` in order to find the seed s needed in `_0x3b9f2e`.

The complete decrypt.py file is the following:
